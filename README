    This is a plugin for the text-editor gedit called 'Addiks git-menu'.
    It works with 'gedit-3.x'.
    It provides an additional menu 'git' when the open file is in a git work-directory.
    This menu holds several git-related options:
        - open git directory
        - checkout
        - pull
        - stage
        - unstage
        - file history (compare revisions)
        - compare with local branches
        - compare with another file
    Besides that it displays the current git-state of the file in the title-bar.


Installation:

    Put or link the folder to '~/.local/share/gedit/plugins'.
    Restart gedit (if running) and activate the plugin in the configuration.
